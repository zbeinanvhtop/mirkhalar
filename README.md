# Introduction

This plugin allows GitLab to trigger builds in Jenkins after code is pushed and/or after a merge request is created.

# User support

If you have a problem or question about using the plugin, please make sure you are using the latest version. Then create an issue in the GitHub project if necessary. New issues should include the following:
* GitLab plugin version (e.g. 1.2.0)
* GitLab version (e.g. 8.1.1)
* Jenkins version (e.g. 1.651.1)
* Relevant log output from the plugin (see below for instructions on capturing this)

Version 1.2.0 of the plugin introduced improved logging for debugging purposes. To enable it: 

1. Go to Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> System Log
2. Add new log recorder
3. Enter 'Gitlab plugin' or whatever you want for the name
4. On the next page, enter 'com.dabsquared.gitlabjenkins' for Logger, set log level to FINE, and save
5. Then click on your Gitlab plugin log, click 'Clear this log' if necessary, and then use GitLab to trigger some actions
6. Refresh the log page and you should see output

You can also try chatting with us in the #gitlab-plugin channel on the Freenode IRC network.

# Known bugs/issues

This is not an exhaustive list of issues, but rather a place for us to note significant bugs that may impact your use of the plugin in certain circumstances. For most things, please search the [Issues](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/issues) section and open a new one if you don't find anything.
* [#272](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/issues/272) - Plugin version 1.2.0+ does not work with GitLab Enterprise Edition < 8.8.3, due to a bug on their side.
* Jenkins versions 1.651.2 and 2.3 removed the ability of plugins to set arbitrary job parameters that are not specifically defined in each job's configuration. This was an important security update, but it has broken compatibility with some plugins, including ours. See [here](https://jenkins.io/blog/2016/05/11/security-update/) for more information and workarounds if you are finding parameters unset or empty that you expect to have values.

# Supported GitLab versions

* 7.14.x where it emulates Jenkins as a GitLabCI Web Service
* 8.1.x and newer via the new commit status API that supports with external CI services like Jenkins

**Note:** GitLab version **8.0.x** is **not** supported! In this version, GitLab folded the GitLabCI functionality into core GitLab, and in doing so broke the ability for the plugin to give build status to GitLab. Jenkins build status will never work with GitLab 8.0.x!

# Supported GitLabCI Functions

* `/project/PROJECT_NAME/builds/COMMIT_SHA1/status.json` (used for Merge Request pages) returns build result for Merge Request build with `COMMIT_SHA1` as last commit
* `/project/PROJECT_NAME/builds/status.png?ref=BRANCH_NAME` returns build status icon for latest build for `BRANCH_NAME`
* `/project/PROJECT_NAME/builds/status.png?sha1=COMMIT_SHA1` returns build status icon for latest build for `COMMIT_SHA1` as last commit
* `/project/PROJECT_NAME/builds/COMMIT_SHA1` redirects to build page of the last build containing `COMMIT_SHA1` as last commit
* `/project/PROJECT_NAME/commits/COMMIT_SHA1` redirects to build page of the last build containing `COMMIT_SHA1` as last commit
* `/project/PROJECT_NAME?ref=BRANCH_NAME` redirects to build page of the last build for `BRANCH_NAME`
* `/project/PROJECT_NAME` triggers a build, type (Merge Request or Push) depending on payload

# Configuring access to GitLab

Optionally, the plugin communicates with the GitLab server in order to fetch additional information. At this moment, this information is limited to fetching the source project of a Merge Request, in order to support merging from forked repositories.

To enable this functionality, a user should be set up on GitLab, with GitLab 'Developer' permissions, to access the repository. You will need to give this user access to each repo you want Jenkins to be able to clone. Log in to GitLab as that user, go to its profile, and copy its secret API key. On the Global Configuration page in Jenkins, supply the GitLab host URL, e.g. ``http://your.gitlab.server.`` Click the 'Add' button to add a credential, choose 'Secret text' as the kind of credential, and paste your GitLab user's API key into the 'Secret' field. Testing the connection should succeed.

## Jenkins Job Configuration
### Git configuration for Freestyle jobs
1. In the *Source Code Management* section:
    1. Click *Git*
    2. Enter your *Repository URL* (e.g.: ``git@your.gitlab.server:group/repo_name.git``)
      * In the Advanced settings, set its *Name* to ``origin``
    3. To be able to merge from forked repositories:  <br/>**Note:** this requires [configuring communication to the GitLab server](#configuring-access-to-gitlab)
      * Add a second repository with:
        * *URL*: ``${gitlabSourceRepoURL}`` 
        * *Name* (in Advanced): ``${gitlabSourceRepoName}``
    4. In *Branch Specifier* enter:
      * For single-repository setups: ``origin/${gitlabSourceBranch}``
      * For forked repository setups: ``${gitlabSourceRepoName}/${gitlabSourceBranch}``
    5. In *Additional Behaviours*:
        * Click the *Add* drop-down button.
        * Select *Merge before build* from the drop-down.
        * Set *Name of the repository" to ``origin`` 
        * Set *Branch to merge* as ``${gitlabTargetBranch}``

**Note:** Since version **1.2.0** the *gitlab-plugin* sets the gitlab hook values through *environment variables* instead of *build parameters*. To set default values, consult [EnvInject Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/EnvInject+Plugin).

### Git configuration for Pipeline/Workflow jobs
**Incompatibility note:** When upgrading to version 1.2.1 or later of the plugin, if you are using Pipeline jobs you will need to manually reconfigure your Pipeline scripts. In older versions the plugin set global Groovy variables that could be accessed as e.g. ${gitlabSourceBranch}. After version 1.2.1, these variables are only accessible in the env[] map. E.g. ${env.gitlabSourceBranch}. 

* A Jenkins Pipeline bug will prevent the Git clone from working when you use a Pipeline script from SCM. It works if you use the Jenkins job config UI to edit the script. There is a workaround mentioned here: https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33719
* Pipeline Multibranch jobs are not currently supported. See https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/issues/298

1. Use the Snippet generator, General SCM step, to generate sample Groovy code for the git checkout/merge etc. 
2. Example that performs merge before build: `checkout changelog: true, poll: true, scm: [$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: "origin/${env.gitlabSourceBranch}"]], doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false, extensions: [[$class: 'PreBuildMerge', options: [fastForwardMode: 'FF', mergeRemote: 'origin', mergeStrategy: 'default', mergeTarget: "${env.gitlabTargetBranch}"]]], submoduleCfg: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[name: 'origin', url: 'git@mygitlab:foo/testrepo.git']]]` 

### Freestyle and Pipeline jobs
1. In the *Build Triggers* section:
    * Check the ``Build when a change is pushed to GitLab.``
    * Use the check boxes to trigger builds on Push and/or Merge Request events and/or Note Request(Comment in Merge Request)
    * Optionally enable building open merge requests again after a push to the source branch.
    * If you check *Note Events* then you should set trigger phrase(exact phrase or Java Regular Expression) in Trigger Phrase field.
2. Configure any other pre build, build or post build actions as necessary
3. Click *Save* to preserve your changes in Jenkins.

### Matrix/Multi-configuration jobs
**The Jenkins Matrix/Multi-configuration job type is not supported.**

## Gitlab Configuration (7.14.x)
* In GitLab go to your repository's project *Settings*
    * Click on *Services*
    * Click on *GitLab CI*
        * Check the *Active* checkbox 
        * For *Token* put any random string (This is not yet functioning)
        * For *Project URL* put ``http://JENKINS_URL/project/PROJECT_NAME``
        * Click *Save*
    * Click on *Web Hooks*
        * Add a Web Hook for *Merge Request Events* to ``http://JENKINS_URL/project/PROJECT_NAME`` <br/>
        **Note:** GitLab for some reason does not send a merge request event with the GitLab Service.

## Gitlab Configuration (>= 8.1)

GitLab 8.1 has implemented a commit status api, you need an extra post-build step to support commit status.

* In GitLab go to you primary repository's project *Settings*
    * Click on *Web Hooks*
    * Add a Web Hook for *Merge Request Events* and *Push Events* to ``http://JENKINS_URL/project/PROJECT_NAME`` <br/>
* If you plan to use forked repositories, you will need to enable the GitLab CI integration on **each fork**.
    * Go to the Settings page in each developer's fork
    * Click on *Services*
    * Click on *Web Hooks*
    * Add a Web Hook for *Merge Request Events* and *Push Events* to ``http://JENKINS_URL/project/PROJECT_NAME`` <br/>
        **Note:** You do not need to select any "Trigger Events" as the Web Hook for Merge Request Events will alert Jenkins.

* Add a post-build step ``Publish build status to GitLab commit (GitLab 8.1+ required)`` to the job.
* For pipeline jobs surround your build step with the gitlabCommitStatus step like this:

    ```
    node() {
        stage 'Checkout'
        checkout <your-scm-config>

        gitlabCommitStatus {
           <script that builds, tests, etc. your project>
        }
    }
    ```
* Configure access to GitLab as described above in "Configure access to GitLab" (the account needs at least developer permissions to post commit statuses)

## Forked repositories
If you plan to use forked repositories, you will need to enable the GitLab CI integration on **each fork**.
* Go to the Settings page in each developer's fork
* Click on *Services*
   * Click on *GitLab CI*
      * Check the *Active* checkbox 
      * For *Token* put any random string (This is not yet functioning)
      * For *Project URL* put ``http://JENKINS_URL/project/PROJECT_NAME``
      * Click *Save* <br />
      **Note:** You do not need to select any "Trigger Events" as the Web Hook for Merge Request Events will alert Jenkins.

In addition, you will need to make sure that the Git plugin has an appropriate setting for user.name and user.email in the global Jenkins configuration. This is good practice generally, but is required for forked repos to work.

1. Click on Manage Jenkins, then Configure System
2. Under the Git Plugin section, set something for 'Global Config user.name Value' and 'Global Config user.email Value'

# Branch filtering

Triggers may be filtered based on the branch name, i.e. the build will only be allowed for selected branches. On the project configuration page, when you configure the GitLab trigger, you can choose 'Filter branches by name' or 'Filter branches by regex.' Filter by name takes comma-separated lists of branch names to include and/or exclude from triggering a build. Filter by regex takes a Java regular expression to include and/or exclude.

**Note:** This functionality requires accessing the GitLab server (see [above](#configuring-access-to-gitlab)) and for the time being also a git repository url already saved in the project configuration. In other words, when creating a new project, the configuration needs to be saved *once* before being able to select the allowed branches. For Workflow/Pipeline jobs, the configuration must be saved *and* the job must be run once before the list is populated. For existing projects, all branches are allowed to push by default.

# Build Tags

In order to build when a new tag is pushed:
* In the ``GitLab server`` add ``Tag push events`` to the ``Web Hook``
* In the ``Jenkins`` under the ``Source Code Management`` section:
    * select ``Advance...`` and add  ``+refs/tags/*:refs/remotes/origin/tags/*`` as ``Refspec``
    * you can also use ``Branch Specifier`` to specify which tag need to be built (exampple ``refs/tags/${TAGNAME}``)

# Parameterized builds

You can trigger a job a manually by clicking ``This build is parameterized`` and adding the any of the relevant build parameters.
These include:

* gitlabBranch
* gitlabSourceBranch
* gitlabActionType
* gitlabUserName
* gitlabUserEmail
* gitlabSourceRepoHomepage
* gitlabSourceRepoName
* gitlabSourceNamespace
* gitlabSourceRepoURL
* gitlabSourceRepoSshUrl
* gitlabSourceRepoHttpUrl
* gitlabMergeRequestTitle
* gitlabMergeRequestDescription
* gitlabMergeRequestId
* gitlabMergeRequestIid
* gitlabTargetBranch
* gitlabTargetRepoName
* gitlabTargetNamespace
* gitlabTargetRepoSshUrl
* gitlabTargetRepoHttpUrl
